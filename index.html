                        Keanu Reeves performance in the horror film 'The Devil's Advocate;' (1997) was
                        well received. Greater stardom came for playing Neo in the science fiction
                        series 'The Matrix', beginning in 1999. He played John Constantine in
                        'Constantine' (2005) and starred in the romantic drama 'The Lake House' (2006),
                        the science fiction thriller 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' (2008), and the
                        crime thriller 'Street Kings' (2008). Following another commercially down
                        period, Reeves made a successful comeback by playing the titular assassin in the
                        'John Wick' film series, beginning in 2014. Time magazine named him one of the
                        100 most influential people in the world in 2022, yet one of the top grossing
                        actors today. In addition to acting, Reeves has directed the film 'Man of Tai
                        Chi' (2013). He plays bass guitar for the band 'Dogstar' and pursued other
                        endeavours such as writing and philanthropy, with emphasis on the latter.</p>
                    <p>ARCH Motorcycle was founded in 2011 to challenge the perception of what an
                        American motorcycle could be. Anything that compromises the ride, aesthetics,
                        stance or function is treated as an opportunity to innovate and improve the
                        design. ARCH owners seek more than just a machine. In 2007 Keanu Reeves, well
                        known for his passion for motorcycles, met custom bike builder Gard Hollinger.
                        Their mutual understanding would eventually lead to the two forming the Arch
                        Motorcycle Company. Reeves employed Hollinger to customize a Harley-Davidson
                        motorcycle, over five years of design and testing Reeves' motorcycle only
                        retained the Harley Davidson engine. Reeves liked the finished product's
                        handling and character so much, he suggested he and Hollinger start a motorcycle
                        company making the motorcycle. Initially, Hollinger refusedâ€” at the time he
                        owned his own motorcycle customization business and was not looking to take the
                        significant step of producing an entire motorcycle and its constituent parts
                        from scratch. According to the pair, Hollinger was eventually convinced by
                        Reeves' persistence and argument that they could produce something great to
                        leave behind as a legacy.</p>
